Plant layout is as important a part of process plant design as it ever was but it is rarely taught as part of chemical engineering courses. The main role of chemical engineers is to design and troubleshoot processes for the production of chemicals fuels foods pharmaceuticals and biologicals to name just a few. Intelligent and thorough preparation of a process-design-basis document can make the difference between a high-quality design for a chemical-process project and a poor one. 12 Overall Process Design Consider the process illustrated in Fig. While process plant layout is a critical aspect of chemical process industries CPI operations the majority of the seminal works in this area have been published in trade journals 110 or classic.</p>
