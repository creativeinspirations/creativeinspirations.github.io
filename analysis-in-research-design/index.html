<p>A traditional research design is a blueprint or detailed plan of how a research study is to be completed. The research design refers to the overall strategy that you choose to integrate the different components of the study in a coherent and logical way thereby ensuring you will effectively address the research problem. A scholar for his research prepare an action plan it constitutes the outline of collection measurement and analysis of data. This means that the research design of a qualitative study differs from that of a study that starts with an understanding to be tested where often the hypothesis literally dictates the form quantity and scope of required data. Some authors consider research design as the choice between qualitative and quantitative research methods.
