Adaptive optics AO is a technique that corrects for optical aberrations. A The opacity of the Earths atmosphere B Defects in the optical figuring such as with the adaptive optics on the Hubble Telescope C Slight tracking errors in trying to compensate for our unsteady rotation D The effects of atmospheric turbulence E The absorption of ultraviolet by the ozone layer.

<p>Shapiro7 and Alan E. Adaptive optics AO is a technology used to improve the performance of optical systems by reducing the effect of wave front distortions. Given the high coherence and monochromaticity of a laser the technique is more straightforward than for more common white-light applications of the astronomical applications. In general however adaptive optical systems cannot sense wave-front. Adaptive optics AO is employed to achieve this task. Adaptive Optics.</p>

<p>The SBIG and Orion adaptive optics works more like the image stabilization in consumer cameras. Erkmen38 Samuel Dolinar3 Moshe Tur4 Mark A. Shapiro7 and Alan E. In addition they may also correct for wave-front errors associated with fixed optical aberrations in the host telescope. Aberrations are distortions in the phase of the light waves that may be present in microscopes either due to imperfections in the optics or due to.
