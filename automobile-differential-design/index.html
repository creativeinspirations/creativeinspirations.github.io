<p>My Project DESIGN AND ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENTIAL GEARBOX mainly focuses on the mechanical design and analysis of gearbox as transmit the power. With fast pacing development of automobile industry and growing needs for better driving experience NVH performance has become an important aspect of analysis in new driveline product development especially in hybrid and electric powered vehicles. This differential makes use of in vex satellite and side gears which mechanically resist differentiation once engaged. Differential gear is modeled in Solid works. In rear-wheel drive cars the differential converts rotational motion of the transmission shaft which lies parallel to the cars motion to rotational motion of the half-shafts on the ends of which are the wheels which lie perpendicular to the cars motion.

<p>The new device incorporates an electric machine which can operate either as a motor or generator and affects torque distribution to the vehicles driving wheels. If the inside tire rotates 15 RPM less in a turn than going straight then the outside tire will rotate 15 RPM more than going straight. On the inner ends of each axle a smaller bevel gear called differential side gear is mounted. A vehicles wheels rotate at different speeds mainly when turning corners.

In rear-wheel drive cars the differential converts rotational motion of the transmission shaft which lies parallel to the cars motion to rotational motion of the half-shafts on the ends of which are the wheels which lie perpendicular to the cars motion. The differential is a device that splits the engine torque two ways allowing each output to spin at a different speed. The differential is designed to drive a pair of wheels with equal torque while allowing them to rotate at different speeds. Analysis is done on the differential by applying tangential and static loads. Gears Mechanic Life Classic Cars Muscle.</p>
