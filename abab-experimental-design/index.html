Of experimental control and 2 obtaining precise measures of behavior. Single-subject research is a group of research methods that are used extensively in the experimental analysis of behavior and applied behavior analysis with both human and non-human participants.</p>

<p>Principal methods in this type of research are. Figure 103 approximates the data for Robbie. Additionally many clinicianseducators prefer the ABAB design because the investigation ends with a treatment phase rather than the absence of an intervention. In an ABAB Reversal design an experimenter rotates two or more conditions and has a participant complete several consecutive sessions in each condition. Reversal designs are particularly useful for the evaluation of medication effects because they provide additional information about the effectiveness of treatment.

<p>Combining two or more single-case designs such as ABAB and multiple baseline stems from a need to obtain answers to more complex research questions Changing criterion design A criterion for reinforcement is changed across the experiment to demonstrate a functional relation between reinforcement and behavior. The A-B-A-B design is recommended for use when reversal designs can be used and when the patients treatment phase needs to be maintained. This approach is often described as the gold standard in the treatment of autism. Designs with an especially clear demonstration of experimental control.

<p>Additionally many clinicianseducators prefer the ABAB design because the investigation ends with a treatment phase rather than the absence of an intervention. ABAB design Intra-participant replication Inter-participant replication Reversible and irreversible behavior Multiple baseline procedures Time-series designs Case Analysis. Designs with an especially clear demonstration of experimental control. Combining two or more single-case designs such as ABAB and multiple baseline stems from a need to obtain answers to more complex research questions Changing criterion design A criterion for reinforcement is changed across the experiment to demonstrate a functional relation between reinforcement and behavior. ABA design also known as a withdrawal or reversal design is a type of single subject experimental design which allows researchers to investigate the effectiveness of an intervention.
