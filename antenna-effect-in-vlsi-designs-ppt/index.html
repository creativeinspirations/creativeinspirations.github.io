RECIVER ANTENNA An antenna used to convert electromagnetic waves in to electrical energy. The antenna ratio of an inter-connect is used to predict if the antenna effect will occur.

<p>A higher ratio implies a greater propensity to fail due to the antenna effect. Antenna ratio is defined as the ratio between the physical area of the conductors making up the antenna to the total gate oxide area to which the antenna is electrically connected. The antenna effect is a phenomenon that may cause damage to the gate oxide of MOS during the fabrication process especially due to the plasma etching process. Design for manufacturability also sometimes known as design for manufacturing or DFM is the general engineering practice of designing products in such a way that they are easy to manufacture.

<p>Because the areasize of the conductor gate area will decide the magnitude of the charge collection. Gifu Hand II Antiroll suspension system Aperture Synthesis SAR and ISAR Application-Specific ICs ASICS Applications of dual-axis Accelerometers Applications of Fuel cells Architectural requirements for a DSP processer Articulatory synthesis Artificial Eye Artificial immune system. The ratio of the gate area to the gate oxide area is known as Antenna ratio. This paper describes the antenna effect observed in the 16nm design and the way to identify antenna violations in design using different PV tool. The antenna ratio of an inter-connect is used to predict if the antenna effect will occur. Download 40 Antenna Effect In Vlsi Design Ppt Download.</p>
