An anechoic chamber is designed to completely absorb reflections of either sound or electromagnetic waves while also being insulated from exterior sources of noise. The anechoic chamber is immensely quiet which makes it ideal for testing very quiet products or people hearing very quiet sounds. The focus on this research is to design and evaluate a split chamber that can be used for measuring random incidence properties of acoustic materials and achieve reliable results for frequencies larger than 500 Hz.

<p>An anechoic chamber is precision acoustical measurement instrument providing a free-field environment or environment without reflections without noise interference or sound reflection. An anechoic chamber is precision acoustical measurement instrument providing a free-field environment or environment without reflections without noise interference or sound reflection. Chamber is designed to provide a highly anechoic sound field and a very small ambient noise level acoustical and mechanical. This paper describes the acoustic design of an anechoic chamber built mainly for the measurement of the acoustic properties of electrical equipment. In order to reduce background noise the anechoic chamber was built on a box within a box principle and mounted on an isolating foundation which consisted of 50 spring vibration isolators.

<p>These controlled environments encompass a wide range of performance specifications from simple quality control. Anechoic Chambers are testing facilities designed purely for acoustic analysis they are echo-free enclosures that provide a free-field environment allowing sound waves to propagate in all directions without obstruction or reflection. This acoustic chamber is built in such a way to minimise the level of acoustic background and acoustic waves reflected from the walls and limit the external noise. The fully anechoic chamber will be used for measuring sound and vibration quantities.
