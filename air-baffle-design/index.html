<p><strong>Air Baffle Design</strong>, I whipped up a 3D model of a baffle system for my return and attaching it here along with a photo of the return with furnace sitting directly above it. 6 shows the air velocities for the arced slot design without screens and with 100 of the air coming out of the arced side. The baffle is a heavy duty component located at the top of the firebox inside a wood burning stove typically made from metal to cope with high temperatures.</p>

<p>THE National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics has undertaken a research to determine the effect of the fundamental factors influencing the cooling of air-cooled radial engines. The baffle controls how much air is pushed through the HVAC system. This design tool integrates together the needed design analysis tools into a single interactive environment.</p>
<h3 id="they-seal-the-gap-on-top-of-the-engine-to-pressurize-the-air">They seal the gap on top of the engine to pressurize the air.</h3><p>Design the tank such that there is sufficient time for air to migrate to the surface. A Qts of around 1 is acceptable for an open baffle bass unit. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. 375 L 18 thick plastic 16 wide. The baffles and baffle seals help to direct air over the cylinders from the high-pressure area to the low-pressure chamber creating an airflow that travels from top to bottom with a few exceptions such as the Piper Navajo and Shrike Commander because of their airframe designand eventually back. The full 3 inch width of the baffle seal strip is seldom necessary but the extra width is handy when cutting out curved strips.</p>

<p>The baffle is a piece of metal slightly smaller than the diameter of the duct. THE National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics has undertaken a research to determine the effect of the fundamental factors influencing the cooling of air-cooled radial engines. The normal recommended value of 20 to 25 cut of shell diameter is used in shell and tube heat exchanger design the larger the cut the lower the pressure drop however this comes with a disadvantage on the heat transfer as the poorly distributed flow with large eddies is produces causing stagnant areas or dead spaces behind the baffles in the shell this results in. Circular baffles are to be avoided. The baffles and baffle seals help to direct air over the cylinders from the high-pressure area to the low-pressure chamber creating an airflow that travels from top to bottom with a few exceptions such as the Piper Navajo and Shrike Commander because of their airframe designand eventually back.

<p>The first part is the right one in the figure 1 which is used to prevent the stray lights with the large incident angle. A friend suggested putting a system of baffles in the return to force the air to make some turns he says it should reduce the noise quite a bit. Design the tank such that there is sufficient time for air to migrate to the surface. Keep the flow in the tank laminar such that air bubbles can rise and use Stokes Law to calculate the time necessary for an air bubble to rise to the surface. In this configuration the flow does not have to make a horizontal turn which might induce mass rotation in the sump.
