<p>Several leading manufacturers are already demonstrating the potential of some of these advanced processes. They can design optimise and operate industrial processes as well as lead engineering projects. The program was a result of emerging research from the Centre for Process Integration initially focused on energy efficiency but expanded to include efficient use of raw materials and emissions reduction. The Virtuoso advanced-node platform improves individual point tools to handle these challenges as well as enables new design methodologies that allow for rapid layout prototyping in-design signoff and close. Hardware integration results from designing the mechatronical system as an overal system and bringing together the sensors actuators and microcomputers into the mechanical system.
