<p><strong>Arch Structure Design</strong>, Structural Design for Architecture Fig. The context required a design which was of the highest architectural quality with a structure which would act as a landmark without dominating surrounding buildings. An arch is a structural member curved in a vertical plane and the loads on the arch are carried by the arch ribs mainly through direct axial thrusts the bending moments and shear forces being small compared to a girder which requires larger section to withstand larger bending moments and shear forces caused by the same loading.</p>

The mechanical principle of the arch is precisely the same as that of the portal frame. This arch was designed by engineer Marc Brunel who is also credited with being the first to use reinforced brick masonry. In this series discuss the structural design of brick masonry arches and lintels. Figure 1 depicts examples of structural masonry arches used.
