Roller lifters employ a small wheel at the bottom of the lifter that allows it to negotiate a very aggressive lobe design with more lift at a given duration and reduced friction. Design is complete it is then the grinders responsibility to translate this profile to the cam as true as possible and with the best surface finish possible. In casting process there are more chances of casting defects such as shrinkage defect porosity crack insufficient pouring.
