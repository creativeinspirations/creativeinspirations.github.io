<p>Online coil performance is available with the most common heat transfer surfaces in the business. The untreated Outside Air OA will be mixed with the Return Air RA before making it to the coils so that the air entering into the coil is the same temperature all over the entire face of the coil instead of for example the left half seeing the return air and the right half seeing the outside air. In the best-case scenario the consequences are costly in terms of replacement of the failed heat exchanger system. When the process fluid to be heated is a corrosive solution it is normally recommended that the coil inlet and outlet connections are taken over the lip of the tank as it is not normally advisable to drill through the corrosion resistant linings of the tank side.

<p>Your ACs coils are key to its operation. The untreated Outside Air OA will be mixed with the Return Air RA before making it to the coils so that the air entering into the coil is the same temperature all over the entire face of the coil instead of for example the left half seeing the return air and the right half seeing the outside air. The Air Design range of Air Handling Units and Fan Coil Units include the latest design and construction technologies to optimise performance and energy efficiency. A well known example of this is the deflection coils placed around a cathode ray tube where the direction of the electron beam. The area includes part of the coil as shown in the diagram above.
