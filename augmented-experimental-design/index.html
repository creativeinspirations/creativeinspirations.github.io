<h3 id="augmented-designs---essential-features">Augmented Designs - Essential Features.</h3><p>This design is commonly used to evaluate a large number of germplasm lines where seed is in small quantity and other designs are not appropriate due to large number of entries. This is an experimental design which is used to test a large number of germplasm lines in a limited area and error estimate with help of checks varieties. The designing of the experiment and the analysis of obtained data are inseparable. One experimental approach called Augmented Design was first introduced by Federer in 1956 Federer WT. Split Plot Designs These designs have two factors one is applied in plots and is defined as trt1 in a randomized complete block design. A new class of augmented experiment designs is presented.</p>

<p>Experimental Designs and Their Analysis Design of experiment means how to design an experiment in the sense that how the observations or measurements should be obtained to answer a query in a valid efficient and economical way. Each location consisted of 90 plots with checks replicated three times. The experimental design for this study was an augmented design which included 75 breeding lines and three checks Horsepower Hayden and Shelby 427. One experimental approach called Augmented Design was first introduced by Federer in 1956 Federer WT. Augmented or hoonuiaku designs. The Exposed Book Layout Design Projects Design.</p>

<p>Augmented designs also use grids or incomplete blocks to remove some field variation from the plot residuals. A survey of the literature reveals that generally these experiments are conducted using an augmented randomized complete block. In this design whole experimental area is divided into N plots N number of test genotypes v number of checks c which are repeated b times at regular intervals. Analysis of Experimental Design. Since interest lies in estimating the block effects and consequently the new variety effects from that portion of the experiment on the check varieties it would be desirable to select augmented block designs which are connected and which satisfy.
