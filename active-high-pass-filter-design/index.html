<p>In an active high pass filter the peak of the passband of the filter can be much larger than the input voltage signal because there is amplification. Band-pass filters are used in the audio frequency range 0 kHz to 20 kHz for modems and speech processing. Active High Pass Filter as its name implies attenuates low frequencies and passes high frequency signals.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-high-pass-filter">What is a High Pass Filter.</h3><p>As the name suggests a high-pass filter circuit is designed to attenuate all frequencies below a particular selected frequency and pass or allow all frequencies above this threshold. It consists simply of a passive filter section followed by an inverting. In the next tutorial about filters we will see that Active High Pass Filters can be constructed by reversing the positions of the resistor and capacitor in the circuit. High-frequency band-pass filters several hundred MHz are used for channel selection in telephone central offices. Use this utility to simulate the Transfer Function for filters at a given frequency or values of R and C. The band pass filter passes a band of frequencies between a lower cutoff frequency f l and an upper cutoff frequency f h.</p>
