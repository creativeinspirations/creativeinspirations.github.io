<p>The research design refers to the overall strategy that you choose to integrate the different components of the study in a coherent and logical way thereby ensuring you will effectively address the research problem. Ex post facto study or after-the-fact research is a category of research design in which the investigation starts after the fact has occurred without interference from the researcher. Such study designs should usually be used in a context where they build on appropriate theoretical qualitative and modelling work particularly in the development of appropriate interventions.
