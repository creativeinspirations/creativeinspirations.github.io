<p><strong>Active Design Strategies</strong>, To put this into context if a passive design provides ventilation and heating using natural non powered systems a building using active design will achieve the same end but have to use technologies such as solar panels heat recovery systems or the use of renewable energy sources such as wind turbines. Active strategies usually consist of heating and cooling systems while passive design measures include building orientation air sealing continuous insulation windows and daylighting and designing a building to take advantage of natural ventilation. Active Design is a set of policy and design strategies for creating healthier streets open spaces and buildings.</p>
