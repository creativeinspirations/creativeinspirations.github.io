<p>The International Building Code IRC and the 2017 Residential Edition of the Florida Building Code FBC R8071 both state that the attic access must be readily accessible and also provide specs for the size of a ceiling or wall access opening.

The most important improvement though was painting the walls light-reflective greens yellows and oranges. For a final bubbly touch OHagan an accomplished fine artist painted cheerful polka dots on the attics end walls. Tyler Residence El Dorado House Exterior Architecture House Architecture.</p>
