In addition to advantages in efficiency and driving range this results in attractive functional synergies and additional degrees of freedom for design and operating strategy which has to be taken into account. A focus for further research is the systematic design and optimisation of the systems and components for the H2 internal combustion engines that differ from the respective baseline powertrain. So ethanol has been used widely as alternative fuel in internal combustion engines. Alternative fuels are not equivalent but to a wide. Alternative fuels for internal combustion engines include a wide range of liquid and gaseous chemicals for both spark-ignition SI and compression-ignition CI applications.</p>

<p>But additional measures are necessary to fulfill todays stringent emission standards and to further increase the efficiency - development targets that only can be reached with modern technologies design methods and tools. Alternative Fuels for Internal Combustion Engines. Alternative fuels for internal combustion engines include a wide range of liquid and gaseous chemicals for both spark-ignition SI and compression-ignition CI applications. In the fundamental sense an internal combustion engine converts the chemical energy available in the fuel conventionally petroleum-based through combustion to thermal energy and through expansion of the working fluid converts the thermal energy to mechanical work with the crank-slider mechanism converting linear forcework to rotational torquework to the output shaft. After my post explaining how internal combustion engines work a number of friends were quick to point out that I hadnt discussed some popular variants of the standard ICE design.
