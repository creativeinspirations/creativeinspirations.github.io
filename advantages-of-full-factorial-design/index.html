<p>Factorial designs are more efficient than OFAT experiments. In this case a Plackett-Burman designs can gather the same information on eleven variables in just 12 tests. The drawback of a fractionated design is that some interactions may be confounded with other effects. Doing a half-fraction quarter-fraction or eighth-fraction of a full factorial design greatly reduces costs and time needed for a designed experiment. By using a factorial design the business researcher can analyze both variables at the same time in one design saving the time and effort of doing two different analyses and minimizing the experiment-wise error rate.

<p>Advantages of the factorial design 2 A two-way design enables us to examine the joint or interaction effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable. An interaction means that the effect of one independent variable has on a dependent variable is not the same for all levels of the other get this information by running separate one-way analyses.

<p>Three-level factorial design A solution to creating a design matrix that permits the estimation of simple curvature as shown in Figure 314 would be to use a three-level factorial design. One of the primary limitations is that Factorial designs confound the effects of proportion and amount. Full Factorial Design leads to experiments where at least one trial is included for all possible combinations of factors and levels. The factorial design as well as simplifying the process and making research cheaper allows many levels of analysis.

<p>Factorial design offers two additional advantages over OFAT. In this lesson discover the different approaches to experimental design such as between-groups within-groups single-factor and factorial and understand the advantages and disadvantages of. Some business researchers use the factorial design as a way to control confounding or concomitant variables in a study. When the effect of one factor is different for different levels of another factor it cannot be detected by an OFAT experiment design.

<p>Such experimental designs are. Some business researchers use the factorial design as a way to control confounding or concomitant variables in a study. The factorial design as well as simplifying the process and making research cheaper allows many levels of analysis. Three-level factorial design A solution to creating a design matrix that permits the estimation of simple curvature as shown in Figure 314 would be to use a three-level factorial design. Factorial design offers two additional advantages over OFAT. 5 Reasons Factorial Experiments Are So Successful.</p>

<p>Full factorial designed experiment in two factors at two levels each in four runs Time sec Temperature C 9 980 9 1020 11 980 11 1020 The average variance of the estimates of the response at the four experimental conditions is 13 higher for the OFAT than for. The factorial design as well as simplifying the process and making research cheaper allows many levels of analysis. For example a 2-level full factorial design with 6 factors requires 64 runs. A design with 9 factors requires 512 runs. Advantages of the factorial design 2 A two-way design enables us to examine the joint or interaction effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable.
