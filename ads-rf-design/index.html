In the ADS online course within four weeks by downloading the free one month ads software and using the examples and pdks provided in this course you would be able to practice practical RFIC simulations and master skills needed for becoming and RF Design Engineer. Advanced Design System is the worlds leading electronic design automation software for RF microwave and high speed digital applications. This presentation illustrates the experience gained by me during a RF circuit design course. The course requirements included designing fabricating and simulating various couplers an amplifier a low noise amplifier and an oscillator. I should make it clear that it performs basic RF simulation only and is nothing like GenesysADS Microwave Office Ansoft Designer HFSS or of that ilk so if you want a full-on EM solver this is not your program.</p>
