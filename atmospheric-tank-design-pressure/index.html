API 650 only covers tanks that support the whole bottom evenly and tanks in non-refrigerated service that have a maximum design temperature of 200 degrees F. API 650 Annex M. The design of atmospheric storage tanks in general is governed by API Std 620 Design and construction of large welded low-pressure storage tanks and API Std 650 Welded steel tanks for oil storage. Tanks should be suitable for their operational duty and all reasonably expected forces such as tank contents ground settlement frost wind and snow loadings.
