<p><strong>Advantages Of Crossover Design</strong>, A crossover design has the advantage of eliminating individual subject differences from the overall treatment effect thus enhancing statistical power. Moreover the crossover design is advantageous regarding the power of the statistical test carried out to confirm the existence of a treatment effect.

<p>Thanks to the greater statistical power a repeated measures design can use fewer subjects to detect a desired effect size. In practice it is not necessary that all permutations of all treatments be used. The increased precision often translates into a smaller sample size.</p>
