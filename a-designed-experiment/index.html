An Introduction to Probability and Statistical Inference Second Edition 2015. Design of experiments DOE is a systematic method to determine the relationship between factors affecting a process and the output of that process. Choosing Input Factors for the Designed Experiment Because I like to use premixed chocolate cake mixes I decided to use two of my favorite cake mix brands for the experiment. This information is needed to manage process inputs in order to optimize the output. This best practice is the first part of a series that will show how to deal with categorical data types in a designed experiment.</p>
