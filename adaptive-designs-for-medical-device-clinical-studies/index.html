Adaptive designs can be applied across all phases of clinical research from early-phase dose escalation to confirmatory trials. In essence adaptive designs allow prospectively planned modifications to a clinical trial based on interim data provided scientific validity the ability to draw sound inferences and data integrity credibility and reproducibility are preserved. An adaptive design clinical trial can help to create a stronger value proposition for your medical device and give you a competitive edge by reducing development costs and accelerating time-to-market. An adaptive design is defined as a design that allows modifications to the trial andor statistical procedures of the trial after its initiation without undermining its validity and integrity.

SMi Groups Adaptive Designs in Clinical Trials Conference will return to London on 3rd and 4th April 2017 and will feature two case studies on Bayesian adaptive designs in medical device development. Known as adaptive design the method can minimize clinical trial sponsors resource requirements and increase chances of study success. An adaptive design for a medical device clinical study is defined as a clinical study design that allows for prospectively planned modifications based on accumulating study data without.

The most frequently appearing type of adaptation was the seamless Phase IIIII design 81142 57 followed by adaptive group sequential 30142 21 biomarker adaptive 28142 20 adaptive dose-finding 23142 16 pick-the-winnerdrop-the-loser 13142 9 sample size re-estimation 11142 8 adaptive randomisation 10142 7 adaptive. The US Food and Drug Administration FDA on Tuesday finalized guidance that lays out how to design medical device clinical trials that allow for changes based on data while maintaining study validity and integrity. Adaptive designs can be applied across all phases of clinical research from early-phase dose escalation to confirmatory trials. It provides clarity on how to plan and implement adaptive designs for clinical studies used in medical device development. Adaptive Design Clinical Trials Jli Blog.</p>
