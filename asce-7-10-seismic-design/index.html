<p>This web tool calculates risk-targeted ground motion values from probabilistic seismic hazard curves in accordance with the site-specific ground motion procedures defined in Method 2 Section 21212 of the ASCESEI 7-10 and 7-16 standards. Importance factors Ie are shown in ASCE 7-10 Table 15-2. Quickly retrieve site structural design parameters specified by ASCE 7-10 ASCE 7-16 and ASCE 7-20 including wind seismic snow ice rain flood tsunami and tornado. Determine design ground motion parameters S dS S d1 6. Under the new ASCE 7-16 standard using a Site Class D response spectrum for the same building will result in a 60 to 80 percent increase in seismic demand relative to ASCE 7-10.
