<p><strong>Air Separation Plant Design</strong>, This paper presents a general review of the design of air separation plants from the initial specifications to the final details. Air separation plants have been considered which are meant for simultaneous production of gaseous and liquid oxygen nitrogen and argon and which are designed according to the schematic diagrams of low pressure medium pressure and two pressures with a nitrogen cycle. Additionally process air contamination from oil and hydrocarbons can combust spontaneously with oxygen.</p>
