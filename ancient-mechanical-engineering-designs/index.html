<h3 id="the-concept-of-engineering-has-existed-since-ancient-times-as-humans-devised-fundamental-inventions-such-as-the-pulley-lever-and-wheel">The concept of engineering has existed since ancient times as humans devised fundamental inventions such as the pulley lever and wheel.</h3><p>The concept of engineering has existed since ancient times as humans devised fundamental inventions such as the pulley lever and wheel. Though the structures that they built like roads and bridges took some inspiration from the Greek civilization the Romans enduring success with building continues to influence modern-day engineers and their civil projects. International Journal of Emerging Engineering Research and Technology V5 I4 2017 12 Mechanical Engineering in Ancient Egypt Part 49. Civil Engineering history commenced in Egypt in 4000 BC followed by the construction of the pyramids the Great Wall in China and other ancient marvels. Ancient China was outstanding in mechanical technology before the 15th century. The Millau Viaduct completed in December 2004 was constructed to alleviate congested traffic on the route from Paris to Barcelona during the summer vacation months.</p>

<p>Engineering in Ancient Rome Ancient Romans engineered structural marvels that have stood the test of time. The Viking longboat along with a related design called the knarr for shipping cargo is a true engineering marvel of the ancient world and in light of the fact that modern replicas have been apocryphally clocked at 25 knots these boats are a marvel to this very day over a millennium later. However due to incomplete documentation and loss of finished objects most of the original machines cannot be verified and many of the inventions did not pass down to later generations.

Each of these inventions is consistent with the modern definition of engineering exploiting basic mechanical principles to develop useful tools and objects. Galal Ali Hassaan Emeritus Professor Department of Mechanical Design Production Faculty of Engineering Cairo University Giza Egypt INTRODUCTION This is the 62 research paper in a series of papers aiming at exploring the development of mechanical engineering in ancient Egypt. But as close to our current concept of an engineering design drawing as the ancient Egyptians were able to produce.
