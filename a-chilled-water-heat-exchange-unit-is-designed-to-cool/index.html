<p>Fixed Type Aqua Mini chillers capacity range is from 5kW to 16kW and they can freely combine with fan coil units. 7C water temp rise 5C Heating. They use the most reliable technologies available today. DB 21C hot water inlet temp 60C Water flow rating is same as cooling 2. It returns to the evaporator where the refrigerant absorbs the unwanted heat and directs it to the condenser.

<p>Determine the maximum water outlet temperature when the mass flow rate of the water is 2 kgs. Chilled or hot water is circulated by a central plant facility. These units are designed for residential applications or light commercial applications that require cold or hot water. - Single refrigerant R134a. A water-cooled chiller removes the heat by circulating cool water through the lines in the condenser.

<p>The chiller basically removes heat from the water. Chilled water cooling is not very different from typical residential air conditioning where water is pumped from the chiller to the air handler unit to cool the air. Chilled water system is designed with versatility in system coupling where there is no limitation in the number of fan coil unit coupling with mini chiller as long as they meet the designed capacity requirament water ﬂow rate. Including a standard chilled water floor mount unit and an air-cooled chiller units with efficiency at standard market levels the pPUE obtained is of 121 in London and 131 in Dubai.
