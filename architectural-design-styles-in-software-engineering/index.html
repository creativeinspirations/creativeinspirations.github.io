<p>A set of design rules that identify the kinds of components and connectors that may be used to compose a system or subsystem together with local or global constraints on the way the composition is done Shaw Clements 1996 A set of constraints you put on your development to elicit desirable IMP properties from your software architecture. Our Superior Construction Project Management Software Makes Managing A Project Simple. Ã Architectural styles and architectural patterns do not describe the detailed design of systems Ã¼ They are used as basis for system decomposition and for analyzing the structure of systems in principled manner. An awareness of these styles can simplify the problem of defining system architectures.
