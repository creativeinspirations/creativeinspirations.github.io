<p>Only one piece of composite drive shat is possible that fulfil all the requirements of drive shaft which is cheapest and lightest but meets all the above load requirements. Optimum design of automotive composite drive shaft with genetic algorithm as optimization tool. We focus mainly on the design and manufacturing of composite plastics for the automotive industry. Speculation on the rising demand for composite moldings used in vehicles predicts that by the year 2017 the market for composites is likely to rise to 955 million dollars US. A composite is composed of a high-performance fiber such as carbon or glass in a matrix material epoxy polymer that when combined provides enhanced properties compared.
