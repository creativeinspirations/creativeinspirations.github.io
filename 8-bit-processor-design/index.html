<p>Later this chip was called as Datapoint. I documented the whole project in a series of YouTube videos and on this web site. The proposed processor will be implemented and synthesized using Xilinx. 1PC - Program counter use an 8-bit register for it 2PC1 can be implemented by using an 8-bit ADDER to add a constant 00000001 to the PC. Implementing an 8-bit Processor-based Design in an FPGA 3. A Complete 8 Bit Microcontroller In Vhdl Microcontrollers 8 Bit Digital Design.</p>

<p>To design this simple processor we need a simple instruction set architecture. The proposed processor consists of the different blocks. I modified the architecture of the SAP-1 found in Digital Computer Electronics for my 8-bit computer. Its small Verilog code demonstrates that it is very easy to design a simple core with processing capabilities. My original processor was designed to be very simple to give me a good chance of making a working processor but it had some serious flaws.

<p>In this implementation I will show you how to design a simple 8-bit single-cycle processor which includes an ALU a register file and control logic using Verilog HDL. The processor is a single-cycle machine so realize that there is a limit to what can be done in one cycle. This work shows the design of an 8-bit RISC soft-core processor dedicated to a complete understanding of computer architecture. The microar-chitecture will be implemented in Verilog a commonly used hardware descriptive. The goal of this project is to design my own functional 8-bit processor.
