It is not common knowledge that refrigeration down up to -60C from thermal energy is a possible solution. Built to last Absorption chillers are built to last under the most extreme conditions for many decades Zudek design them to last for more than 30 years. Lithium Bromide is more common because it is safer and non toxic so well look at how the water Lithium Bromide type chillers work. The system uses two coolants the first of which performs evaporative cooling and is then absorbed into the second coolant. Instead they use water as the refrigerant and this is mixed with either ammonia or Lithium Bromide.</p>
