<p>1 617 455 4188 Central. Computational design allows designers to program the behaviour of a complex architectural system such as the building facades. Parametric Facade Reference Facade Amano Design Office Architect Yoshihiro Amano came up with the design for the Dear Jingumae Building after being asked to give the existing structure a new frontage that would allow it to stand out from its neighbors. Following the sequence of architectural production - from design to fabrication and construction up to the operation of buildings - the book discusses the impact of computational methods and technologies and its consequences for the education of future architects and designers. The MAA program focuses on select Research Lines all led by internationally renowned experts and bringing together students and faculty from different disciplines and origins towards the creation of a networked hub of excellence the IAAC Community dedicated to research and innovation for the habitability of the 21st Century.
