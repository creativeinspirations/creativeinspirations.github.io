Basic structure of a feed forward active noise control system 3. Active noise cancellation uses carefully located microphones signal digitization and sophisticated adaptive algorithms to create inverted signals to cancel out offending audio-band noise while leaving the desired sound unchanged resulting in a quiet background and better listening or resting experience. Active noise cancellation ANC is rapidly evolving as a technology area that enables car manufacturers to simultaneously differentiate their vehicles while enhancing the overall passenger experience.
