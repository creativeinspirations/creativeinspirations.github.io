<p><strong>Angular Contact Bearing Design</strong>, Angular contact ball bearings are suitable for applications which require high accuracy and good high-speed performance. A question does arise that Why are these bearings called as Angular Contact Bearings. These bearings have a contact angle so that they can sustain significant axial loads in one direction together with radial loads.</p>

<h3 id="in-angular-contact-ball-bearings-the-line-of-action-of-the-load-at-the-contacts-between-balls-and-raceways-forms-an-angle-with-the-bearings-axis">In angular contact ball bearings the line of action of the load at the contacts between balls and raceways forms an angle with the bearings axis.</h3><p>These bearings have a contact angle so that they can sustain significant axial loads in one direction together with radial loads. These bearings have a contact angle so that they can sustain significant axial loads in one direction together with radial loads. This design allows the angular contact bearing to have a high load capacity. Double row angular contact ball bearings Design of bearing arrangements In order to make comprehensive use of the performance capacity of the bearings the adjacent construction must be of an appropriate design. The structure of double row angular contact ball bearings is designed by arranging two single row angular contact bearings back-to-back in duplex DB to form a single bearing with a contact angle of 25. These include 30BG05S5G-2DS 30BD40-T12 BALL BEARING 3810-2RS DOUBLE ROW BALL BEARING 5305-2RS DOUBLE ROW BALL BEARING.</p>
