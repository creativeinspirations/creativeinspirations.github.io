<p>The Architecture and Engineering team will continue to advance the physical requirements and building component relationships. These definitions establish a common vocabulary to assist in the design and construction of low to zero carbon buildings and beyond. This paper was developed as a collaboration between the American Institute of Architects and the American Institute of Steel Construction. For example in the dealing with Authorities Having Jurisdiction and obtaining approvals for a project which can be indeterminate in complexity and time it may be fair to compensate the Architect on an agreed-to hourly rate. DD tasks build on the approved schematic design to reach a level of completeness that demonstrates the project can be built.
