<p>The two possible hollow cross sections ie Rectangular section and Circular Sections is modelled using commercially available 3D modelling tool known as SolidWorks and they are further studied and compared. An articulated robot is analyzed by considering the motor load. It allows two surgeons to teleoperate the Raven IV system col-laboratively from two remote sites. Design and Implementation of Pick and Place Robotic Arm 2015 had design a 4 DOF articulated robotic manipulator with gripper for pick and place operation. The end effectorgripper is a rough design but the rest of the robot is designed according to the dimensions.

<p>11 Robot Arm Details and Summary The robotic arm will be controlled via the designed controller and it will be able to grab pick up and move objects according to their weights and shape. Six degree of freedom articulated robotic arm by means of design and analysis followed by manufacturing specific to a particular work envelope and payload. This was the bachelor thesis project during the under-graduate study at Sardar Patel College of Engineering an autonomous institute affiliated to the University of Mumbai India. The robotic arms design process included several static and dynamic calculations mechanical properties calculations and prototype testing in order to provide a final product with well. There are 5 joints and therefore 5 axes. Robot Arm Robot Mechanical Design.</p>
