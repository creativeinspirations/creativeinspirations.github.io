<p>Its important to know that ancient Greek art was mainly comprised of vases sculpture and architecture lasted around 1600 years and covered a number of of different periods. The city-state of Athens which became a significant cultural political and religious place during this period was its centre where the theatre was institutionalised as part of a festival called the Dionysia which honoured the god Dionysus. The stage was entered from either side and from a central door in the stage building representing palace temple and sometimes pavilion tomb or cave in tragedy. Acoustics 2019 1 1 337-353. The Greek open-air theater was first a circular flat orchestra pit located in the hollow between two hillsides. Pin On Sams History Theatre.</p>

<p>In the beginning it was only a few boards raised on trestles to form a sort of stage in the open air. This provided an adequate view of the performance space for all patrons. The most important feature of the Roman theatre as distinct from the Greek theatre was the raised stage. For comedy three doors are certain for the 4th cent and were probably available in the 5th. Ancient Greek theatre was a theatrical culture that flourished in ancient Greece from 700 BC. Pin On Greek Theatre.</p>
