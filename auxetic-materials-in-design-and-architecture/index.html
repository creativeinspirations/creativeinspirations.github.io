<p>Auxetic structures are fabricated by additive manufacturing soft lithography machining technology compressed foaming and textile fabrication using various biomaterials including poly ethylene glycol diacrylate polyurethane poly lactic-glycolic acid chitosan hydroxyapatite and using a hard material such as a silicon wafer. A number of methods have been proposed to find new auxetic materials some of which Microstructure of rely on transforming non-auxetic materials into an auxetic form foams whereas others auxetic materials employ structural techniques and new architectural shapes to achieve the auxetic effect by changing the shape of the base cell of the material.

Our contribution is to derive new principles for auxetic design from the geometric theory of auxetic deformations recently introduced in 6.

<p>This is the basis to interpolate the surface between the actuators. Auxetic materials are characterized by the uncommon capacity of extending sideways when pulled longitudinally while contracting laterally under compressive action. From the microstructural and molecular to the mesoscopic and macroscopic scales Evans 2000. Material properties can be tailored through modification of their geometry or architecture. Auxetic Structures are a class of meta-materials uniquely characterised by their Negative Poissons Ratio thus when a lateral force is applied the structure expands longitudinally becoming thicker and stronger perpendicular to the strain.
