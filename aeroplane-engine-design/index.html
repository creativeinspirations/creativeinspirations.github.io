<p>Software complexes enable to execute separate project stages with using state-of-the-art optimization methods optimization in order to provide high efficiency of the airplane during its whole life-cycle. Otto built the first practical four-stroke internal combustion engine called the Otto Cycle Engine and as soon as he had completed his engine he built it into a motorcycle. The writing of the third edition of Aircraft Engine Design began as soon as the second. Software complexes enable to execute separate project stages with using state-of-the-art optimization methods optimization in order to provide high efficiency of the airplane during its whole life-cycle.
