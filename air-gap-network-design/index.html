An air gap air wall or air gapping is a network security measure applied to on one or more computers to ensure that they are physically isolated from unsecured networks such as the public internet or an unsecured local area network. Two storage networks are used to create a redundant storage network topology with each storage network physically and logically isolated from the other by an air gap. The concept is that a physical gap can stop hackers and their tools such as malware or unauthorized remote access software. Understanding Network Air Gaps.

<p>Two storage networks are used to create a redundant storage network topology with each storage network physically and logically isolated from the other by an air gap. Even in air gapped OT environments files must be exchanged with the outside world. Only through physically bridging the network such as through the introduction of removable media can data flow in or out of the network in question. An air gap is a physical gap between the control network and other networks such as business networks or the Internet.
