<p><strong>Atomic Design Component Library</strong>, Component Libraries borrow some concepts from atomic design so its important to understand some of its basics. Working in front-end workshop environments like Storybook or Pattern Lab were able to use atomic design to simultaneously build a design system component libraries as well as entire pilot project screens and all the recipes and snowflakes that comprise them. Atomic design provides a clear methodology for crafting design systems.</p>

Clients and team members are able to better appreciate the concept of design systems by actually seeing the steps laid out in front of them. With Atomic Design developers can take site elements independently rather than as a single brick that all needs to move at once.
