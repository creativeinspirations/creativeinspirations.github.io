<p>There are advantages in having a steeper angle for the diagonal members and also disadvantages. The center girt is 40cm wide and is welded up from 2 x 2 angle bar 5mm for the frame and 3mm for the webbing. Made from A36 steel is connected.</p>

Suppose we are interested in designing a truss that has a minimum weight will not yield will not buckle and. And design of structural steel - concrete composite trusses are discussed. It eludes me at the moment but the truss style you mention has a generic name. Design engineers normally try to keep it at 45 as it is the best compromise. Greater depths with lesser number of panels and steeper angles result in lesser chord forces.</p>

<p>And it isnt actually structural angle iron or even re-bar. It is desired to specify the appropriate angle sections that will safely carry the anticipated loading using Eurocode design code Specified steel grade S 275. My thought was to make a simple warren truss out of 2 x 2 angle iron and 1 12 x 18 flat bar welding the flat into the inside of angle iron then placing a 9x2 piece of timber into it and bolting it all together to give the truss an infill so to speak.
