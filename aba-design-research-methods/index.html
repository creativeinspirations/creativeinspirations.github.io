<p>B 2012 In applied behavior analysis ABA research typically takes place by observing a person for specific behaviors and then to try and modify those behaviors by stopping them if they are negative or by starting new behaviors if they are positive. ABA designs also known as reversal designs are among a family of single-case experimental designs most often used by behavioral scientists and educators to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical or educational interventions. While most published psychological research is based on between group research designs ABA typically examines behavior at the level of the individual and generally utilizes single-case research designs SCD thus permitting a scientifically valid conclusion to be drawn from the intensive investigation of an individual Blampied 1999. These children require people with specialized training though. 68 The textbook by Bloom et al.
