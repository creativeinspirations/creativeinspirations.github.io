<h3 id="it-is-time-to-design-your-application-so-that-it-is-object-oriented">It is time to design your application so that it is object oriented.</h3><p>The first step is to design a class that represents a product category that your company sells. Answer 1 of 8. If you are practicing on OOPs the design benefit a user will get is in terms of designing and fixing things easily and eliminating the risks if any. In addition once a program reaches a certain size Object Oriented Programs are actually easier to program than non-Object Oriented ones. The approach of this model builds on common paradigms that most people use to deal with complexity. That is because of the modular classes are so flexible in their application.</p>
