<p>Answer 1 of 5. The objective of this experiment is to design a common emitter amplifier using a bipolar junction transistor and to study the characteristics of the designed amplifier. Well basically Grounding in this case just means the point in the circuit the designer decided to call zero volts and use as a reference voltage when measuring voltages elsewhere in the circuit - it does not imply an actual connection to the earth. Amplifier is an electronic circuit that controls a large output signal using a small input signal. It is called the common-emitter configuration because ignoring the power supply battery both the signal source and the load share the emitter lead as a common connection point shown in the figure below.

<p>The objective of this experiment is to design a common emitter amplifier using a bipolar junction transistor and to study the characteristics of the designed amplifier. The voltage g - Sarthaks eConnect Largest Online Education Community. Electrons move from collector to base. Transistors are used either as a switching or amplifying purposeThere are many types of transistorsThey are given below. Lets take a closer look at common-emitter transistor amplifiers and discuss some things designers should consider during the common-emitter transistor.
