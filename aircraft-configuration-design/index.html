<p>The basic configuration of the empennage has already been established in Section 4 with the configuration of the aircraft. The aircraft design process is a loosely defined method used to balance many competing and demanding requirements to produce an aircraft that is strong lightweight economical and can carry an adequate payload while being sufficiently reliable to safely fly for the design life of the aircraft. The role of the conceptual aircraft design is to propose aircraft configurations that can best meet a set of needs then to identify several design alternatives.

<p>The aircraft design process is a loosely defined method used to balance many competing and demanding requirements to produce an aircraft that is strong lightweight economical and can carry an adequate payload while being sufficiently reliable to safely fly for the design life of the aircraft. In this section the various types of empennage will be looked at more closely in order to define the exact configuration. The wing configuration describes the arrangement and design of an aircrafts lifting and lift-related surfaces. 41 Three-View Drawings of Conventional Aircraft Configurations Three-view drawings are the most important medium to communicate within aircraft design.

<p>41 Three-View Drawings of Conventional Aircraft Configurations Three-view drawings are the most important medium to communicate within aircraft design. Work force in these phases is still limited compared to the whole development workload. Similar to but more exacting than the usual engineering design process the technique is highly iterative. The aircraft design process is a loosely defined method used to balance many competing and demanding requirements to produce an aircraft that is strong lightweight economical and can carry an adequate payload while being sufficiently reliable to safely fly for the design life of the aircraft.
