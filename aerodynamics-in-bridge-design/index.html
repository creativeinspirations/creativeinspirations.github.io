This textbook is intended for studies in structural dynamics or wind engineering with special focus on the stochastic theory of wind induced dynamic response calculations for slender bridges or other line- like civil engineering type of structures. But nowadays some large vessels have so much superstructure above the water that they have to be designed carefully too or the ship could rock badly in high winds or even become unstable. The weight torsional stiffness and especially the shape of the cross section of a suspension bridge deck determine the stability of the bridge in strong winds. We bridge the gap between a deep understanding of technology and clear performance outcomes.

<p>Long span suspension bridges are flexible structures which are highly sensitive to the action of the wind hence aerodynamic performance often becomes a governing factor in the design process. BRIDGE AERODYNAMICS Optimizing bridge performance and safety through comprehensive analyses modeling and testing presented in simple design-ready results Cable-supported arch-and-truss bridges are expressions of elegance and functionality. Egger Cable Surface for the Reduction of Risk Associated with Bridge Cable Ice Accretions Structural Engineering International 29 2019 425-432. Subtle changes to the cross section of the bridge have a big effect on how stable the bridge is in strong winds. Implications of the Rules on bridge designpast and future Authors.
