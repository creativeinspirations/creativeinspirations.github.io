<p>Defining Product Design. Product design is essential in creating the initial user experience and product offering from pre-ideation user research to concept development to prototyping and usability testing. Product designers plan and develop items for use in homes businesses and industry. We can classify Product design into various categories such as mechanical product design electrical product design etc. Our ASA level Design and Technology specification provides a unique opportunity in the curriculum for learners to identify and solve real problems by designing and making products or systems.
