<p>The first objective of this thesis is to identify a process framework for design systems to be implemented in the development of public sector digital services. This involves identifying the different components that go into the design system and proposing a process framework which takes into account the digital service implementation processes in public sector. It is a practical methodology and process that guides the development of new innovative products and services processes business models and strategies.
