<p>Stinson EE 371 Lecture 1 2 Class Overview This class builds on EE313 and EE271 to look at the circuit design issues in large digital VLSI chips. Advanced VLSI architecture designs are required to further reduce power consumption compress chip area and speed up operating frequency for high performance integrated circuits. Informations on Schedule and Room can be found on PAUL. Over the past several years Silicon CMOS technology has become the dominant fabrication process for relatively high performance and cost effective VLSI circuits. CMOS VLSI Design for Power and Speed consideration Historical Perspective and Future Trends in CMOS VLSI Circuit and System Design - Logical Effort - A way of Designing Fast CMOS Circuits - Power Estimation and Control in CMOS.
