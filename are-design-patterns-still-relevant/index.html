<p>A common argument is that design patterns reside at a lower level of abstraction than most developers work on. So is the F-pattern still relevant. Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Even though the GoF Design Patterns book was published over 20 years ago it still continues to be an Amazon best seller. Many would answer No to this question.
