<p>Regardless of dimensions number of fins shape or material a board is asymmetrical when one or more elements on one side of its central axis differ from the other side. Donald Brink discusses asymmetrical surfboard design - YouTube. The Asymmetrical surfboard is nothing new dating as far back to the 60s and the Ekstrom design. Surfboard design has come so far that. With so many technological developments happening at such a fast pace creative minds are propelled to constantly ask. Asymmetrical Surfboard Surfboard Surf Design Surfboard Design.</p>

<p>The 21 st century. With so many technological developments happening at such a fast pace creative minds are propelled to constantly ask. At any rate thought Id throw some pics out there and maybe open this up to get some inspiration and hopefully good conversation on asymmetrical board design. Midget Farrellys hooktail and San Diego in Carl Ekstroms designs the asym has lingered on the outside watching as surfboards got smaller and more sophisticated but remaining symmetrical throughout the decades. The thinking obviously being that you dont necessarily need the same performance characteristics out of the front-side of your surfboard as you do out of the back-side so design each half the surfboard to suit the optimal needs.

<p>Slightly odd looking theyre predominantly designed to perform whilst surfing in a single direction so either left or right. The Donald Brink Interview. At the cutting edge of modern surfboard design is the asymmetrical board and its certainly the most unique of all the surfboard shapes out there. Tim Bessell of Bessell Surfboards is a big believer in asymmetrical designs. This design concept is a rational and logical step in producing a board that specifically takes into consideration the differences between front side and backside surfing.
