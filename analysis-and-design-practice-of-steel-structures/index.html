<p>In the present study the influence of reinforcement on the circular cell steel honeycombs structures under axial compressive load was investigated using numerical analysis in Abaqus-CAE. DEAD LOAD IMPOSED LOAD only Fu Î³ Gj Gk Î³ Qk Qk. It was intended to be easy foruse by practisingengineers. Every component of the structure comprising the beams and columns is designed in compliance with the code IS 8002007.

<p>The topic of connections is often given only limited attention in structural analysis and design of buildings despite the fact that they can play a critical role in the structure. However where any discrepancies occur between these calculations and the working drawings the Engineer shall be notified immediately so proper action may be taken. The structural design is intended to be based primarily on the current Nepal Building Code of Practice. The description is intended to provide both analysis and design methods as well as understandings to structural engineers enabling them to design and build cold-formed steel structures rationally. The analysis of steel constructions for their seismic design is commonly based on structural models where only beams columns and braces contribute to the seismic response while cladding panels.
