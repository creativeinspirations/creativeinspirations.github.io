<p>They are able to efficiently evaluate aggregate production splits and properties as well as project criteria in order to create a cost-effective asphalt mixture that will meet the project specification. A reputable hot mix asphalt producerproviding standard mixescan readily furnish the engineer with a written Job Mix Formula. Since the 1990s asphalt research has focused on binders aggregate gradations and shapes laboratory compactive effort and the field performance of mixtures. The mix design at OBC is then tested with the selected mixture rutting and cracking tests. The history of asphalt mix design has changed significantly over the years with the goal always to create stable and durable pavements.
