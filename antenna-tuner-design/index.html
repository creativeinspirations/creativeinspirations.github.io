The EZ-Tuner - The EZ-Tuner is a homebrew automatic legal-limit antenna tuner that covers all amateur HF bands from 160-10 meters. When it is cut out the back lamination comes away and the paper side can be simply glued to the box with suitable glue. The range of impedances for which any given tuner design can achieve maximum efficiency is ordinarily quite a bit narrower than for achieving a mere 11 SWR on the transmitter side. Hence it is called very versatile tuner circuit. Pin On Ham.</p>

With proper system design an antenna tuner or transmatch can allow a non-resonant antenna to operate nearly as efficiently as one that is carefully cut to resonance. Instead of using link coupling to the antenna his design uses capacitive coupling to the main coil. The circuit can be converted to L-network type by setting any one capacitor to value of zero. For each band change the taps had to be moved and reoptimized the total inductance changed and the tuning capacitor retuned. Tuner Atu Ham Radio Antenna Radio Antenna Hf Radio.</p>

<p>Design 1955 17 Two Tuning Knobs. Due to different antennas and operating frequencies the impedance presented by the antennas can vary greatly. Two dual-section air variable capacitors - 470 pf per section. Instead of using link coupling to the antenna his design uses capacitive coupling to the main coil.

<p>ANTENNA DESIGN 140 -150 MHZ VHF TRANSCEIVERS Online Edition. With proper system design an antenna tuner or transmatch can allow a non-resonant antenna to operate nearly as efficiently as one that is carefully cut to resonance. FOUND THIS SITE USEFUL. The circuit can be converted to L-network type by setting any one capacitor to value of zero. The panel design was then printed out and laminated with an extra piece of paper behind it.
