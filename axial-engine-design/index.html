<p>After both motors were completely designed they were simulated three dimensionally through the FEM and the. Each OEM is looking at specific configurations as the different size and form factor of the axial motor changes the design of an EV.

<h3 id="that-opens-up-new-design-options-within-the-vehicle-platform-such-as-where-to-place-the-battery-packs">That opens up new design options within the vehicle platform such as where to place the battery packs.</h3><p>The internal rotating structure carries the majority of reciprocating inertial loads so the external engine. Axial-flux motor designs also impact electromagnetics characteristics because magnetic flux travels shorter distances. The motors higher power density means that a smaller axial motor can be used compared to a radial motor. The internal rotating structure carries the majority of reciprocating inertial loads so the external engine. Making those improvements is trickier in radial motors with an in-runner design where the rotor is inside the stator. This engine with its small design less than 1 inch thick.</p>

<p>What are the Applications of Axial Flux Motor. This aspect of axial-flux motor design typically deli vers a 30 torque density advantage over a conventional radial motor. New generation non-fossil fuels could work best with an all-new engine design&ndash;with the radial power plant making a comeback. His brushed DC motor design held the magnets stationary with a spinning armature activated by sliding brushes as the rotor. That opens up new design options within the vehicle platform such as where to place the battery packs.

<p>Making those improvements is trickier in radial motors with an in-runner design where the rotor is inside the stator. The motor will be controlled by a 3 cycle. Duke re-imagined the design utilizing a reciprocator converting the linear layout into a circular or axial configurationand the results are stunning. Axial flux motors were studied by British inventor and EV enthusiast Cedric Lynch as early as 1979. Because the axial and transverse motor designs can have the rotating member located on their outer diameter they create higher torque while reducing their motor footprint.
