<p><strong>A Frame Suspension Design</strong>, The basic theories and methodologies for designing these systems are presented so that new teams will have a baseline for their first FSAE design. The process entails Selecting appropriate vehicle level targets. Of course one aims to avoid compromise in any direction but inevitably some criteria will be given priority over others.</p>

<p>The best choice is the telescopic fork positioned with some degree of castor angle to ensure that the car drive straight when you let go of the wheel. The process entails Selecting appropriate vehicle level targets. A good suspension must therefore incorporate a good kinematics design to keep the tire as perpendicular to the pavement as possible optimal damping and spring rates to keep the tire on the ground at all times and strong components that do not deflect under the loads induced upon them.</p>

<p>There are 10 key factors to be considered when designing a suspension system whether its for a single seater or sports prototype and part of the skill of the designer lies in reconciling the conflicts between them. Unsprung weight or the weight comprised by tire wheel and suspension affects how well the tire follows the bumps and dips in the road surface. The design of suspension of a race car is complex.

<p>The simplest form of an A-frame is two similarly sized beams arranged in an angle of 45 degrees or less attached at the top like an uppercase letter A. The springs and shocks were relocated to remain in plane with the suspension to eliminate side loading and bearing wear. The basic theories and methodologies for designing these systems are presented so that new teams will have a baseline for their first FSAE design. Two arms mounted perpendicular to the frame attach to an upright that holds the hub assembly. An A-frame is a basic structure designed to bear a load in a lightweight economical manner. 2012 Iconic Ac Roadster Rigid Suspension Roadsters Chassis Fabrication New Cars.</p>
