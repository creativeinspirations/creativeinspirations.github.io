Active Design Active design on the other hand is a structure or system that either uses or is able to produce electricity itself which is something that describes the overwhelming majority of buildings that exist. With passive design building features such as orientation thermal mass insulation and glazing work together to take advantage of natural sources of heating and cooling such as sun and breezes and to minimise unwanted heat gain and loss. Active strategies usually consist of heating and cooling systems while passive design measures include building orientation air sealing continuous insulation windows and daylighting and designing a building to take advantage of natural ventilation opportunities.
