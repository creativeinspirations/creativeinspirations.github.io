<p>Digital radio and television. Electronic Crossover Networks are used to improve the sound of a sound system by separating the high frequency sounds from the low frequency sounds and using a separate power amplifier and speaker for each. Thats pretty pretentious of companies because i know a lot of experienced technologists who are more useful than some engineers with higher degrees.</p>
