<p>Active Low-Pass Filter Design 3 The choice of circuit topology depends on performance requirements. Active filters are RC networks that include an active device such as an operational ampli- fier op amp. The MFB is generally preferred because it has better sensitivity to component variations and better high-frequency behavior. The basic concept of a filter can be explained by examining the frequency dependent nature of the impedance of capacitors and inductors. Originally published in 1981 Modern Filter Design remains a classic statement of the principles underlying the analysis and design of active RC and switched capacitor filters. Pin On Electronics.</p>
