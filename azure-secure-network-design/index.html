<p><strong>Azure Secure Network Design</strong>, This reference document links the technical design aspects of Microsoft Azure with Palo Alto Networks solutions and then explores several technical design models. The design models include multiple options with all resources in a single VNet to enterprise-level operational environments that span across multiple VNets using a Transit VNet. A secure remote worker is simplified using foundational access and business capability groups.</p>

Update - June 2018 Despite that this post isnt even a year old Ill be updating it with. Our On-Premises knowledge to create Security Zones model can be applied to our Azure environment. We need to work together with Microsoft as our Cloud Vendor to secure our Azure environment. Microsoft Azure Security Engineer as the name suggests is specifically for the Engineers who want to learn implement and manage security controls access management and become responsible for securing the cloud computing data and other information related including applications and networks.
