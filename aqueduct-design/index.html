<p>Aqueduct Design Around the year 500 AD the Romans built a system of aqueducts to bring fresh water from the hills around Rome into the city to supply the million or so people who lived there. In addition to the above considerations the following criteria should be adopted while designing the siphon aqueducts. The aqueducts were for the most part open masonry channels down which water flowed under the impetus of gravity. It flowed in two channels one being cleaned and maintained and one to keep a constant flow of water. In modern engineering however aqueduct refers to a system of pipes ditches canals tunnels and supporting structures used to convey water from its source to its main distribution point.
