<h3 id="research-design-is-a-plan-to-answer-your-research-question">Research design is a plan to answer your research question.</h3><p>Giving students an assessment of knowledge the first day of class and giving the same assessment on the last day of class is an example of a research design based on a single-sample repeated measures. The research design refers to the overall strategy that you choose to integrate the different components of the study in a coherent and logical way thereby ensuring you will effectively address the research problem. A case-study research design is useful in those scenarios where there is not much information is known or available about the phenomena. These designs are often referred to as patched-up research designs Poister 1978 and usually they do not test all the causal linkages in a logic model. The research assessment tools describe the information that should be available in study reports and the key features of a high quality study design. It should create a positive climate that encourages interaction and dialogue.</p>
