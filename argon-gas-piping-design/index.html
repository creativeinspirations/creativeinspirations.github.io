<p>30122 - Required Pressure Containment or Relief. Many manufacturing applications use argon or nitrogen gas for inert purging and blanketing. Gases such as silane phosphine diborane and arsine are commonly used in the semi-conductor industry and are extremely dangerous to handle because they do not require a source of ignition to explode or catch fire.</p>
<h3 id="argon-is-an-expensive-gas-and-is-used-in-applications-such-as-arc-welding-where-nitrogen-may-react-with-the-electric-arc">Argon is an expensive gas and is used in applications such as arc welding where nitrogen may react with the electric arc.</h3><p>The piping used in oxygen piping system design must be cleaned before the use as well as after the set up. Large inside diameters provide excellent flow rates. Piping systems in other industries covered in the ASME B313 Code include piping typically found in petroleum re-fineries chemical textile and paper plants that for the most part consist of metallic pipe installed with multipass manual welds with filler metal added to the weld. This unique pipe design provides high strength and pressure ratings while offering the benefits of a pipe that bends easily and stays bent. 30122 - Required Pressure Containment or Relief.
