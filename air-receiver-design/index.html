Air receiver is used as a storage reservoir for compressed air. Air receiver tanks are sized in gallons and range from small 5- and 10-gallon tanks to massive tanks that hold thousands of gallons of air. Maximum permissible switching cycles per hour of the largest switching compressor. Today most compressed-air-system consultants compressor manufacturers and design engineers have put aside the myth of using piping for storage. 18 Maximum working pressure at which the air receiver is allowed to operate.</p>

<p>The calculation is displayed symbolically as. An air receiver attached to your air compressor installation helps to decrease loading and unloading cycles on the compressor itself easing its overall workload. The ideal size of an air receiver tank will depend on the type of air compressor and. The air receiver is a type of pressure equipment that may require design and item registration under the Work Health and Safety Regulations. Each air receiver should be equipped with a pressure relief valve which is designed to release pressure from the tank in case the tank reaches its maximum allowable pressure inside the vessel.

<p>The initial pressure is the design pressure the receiver. The Air Receivers can be supplied under any third party CCE inspection agency according to customer specific requirements. This calculation uses the air consumption rate of the instruments and determines the size of an air receiver based on the time required to meet a minimum pressure. This design allows them to withstand vibrations generated by the motor and pump. Each air receiver should be equipped with a pressure relief valve which is designed to release pressure from the tank in case the tank reaches its maximum allowable pressure inside the vessel.
